# About Sightreading.training

This site is a free way to practice [sight
reading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sight-reading) by playing randomly
generated sheet music or by playing along with pre-programmed songs.
Additionally, you'll find some other tools to help you with your ear and music
theory in general.

**This project is 100% free & open-source**, you can contribute to development
on GitHub: <https://github.com/leafo/sightreading.training>

## A Work In Progress

This app is far from complete and is still being developed. If you have ideas
or feedback please [post on our
tracker](https://github.com/leafo/sightreading.training/issues).

## Note on Tooltips

For many of the exercises, the UI can be quite dense and complicated. Although
it would be nice to address this in the future, in the meantime you can often
hover over buttons, checkboxes, inputs and sliders to see a tooltip describing
in more details what the control changes. If you are still having trouble
understanding how something works feel free to [open a ticket
here](https://github.com/leafo/sightreading.training/issues).

> Unfortunately this doesn't work so well on mobile devices. We recommend
> getting familiar with the software on your desktop or laptop before adapting
> your training to a tablet or phone.

## Sounds

This app has a built in piano & metronome instrument. Alternatively, you can
configure a MIDI output device so you can have any synthesizer generate sound
for you. Configure sound by clicking the **MIDI** button on the top right of
the page.

If you're using *[Play Along](/play-along)* mode with MIDI output, a metronome is played on
channel 10. It should be a GM Drum Kit to sound correctly.

## The Tools

There are many different tools included to practice your music and sight reading skills:

* **[Staff](/)** -- Notes are randomly generated for you to sight read and play. This will ensure that you're always reading and never playing from memory. In the simplest mode you'll play one note at a time, but you can increase complexity by clicking **configure**, and changing how notes are generated. In order to play more than 1 note at a time you need a MIDI controller connected!
* **[Play Along](/play-along)** -- Pre-programmed songs are available for you to play. You can control the playback speed, and configure a metronome by using the MIDI output option.
* **[Ear Training](/ear-training)** -- Various tools to practice your ear, including interval recognition and playing back a melody.
* **[Flash Cards](/flash-cards)** -- Generates random flash cards to help you memorize or quickly identify things related to music theory

## Using a MIDI Keyboard

Although it's possible to play using your mouse or computer keyboard, we
recommend connecting your digital piano or MIDI keyboard to your computer so
you can play directly into the software. A MIDI keyboard is required to enter
multiple notes at the same time.

MIDI support is only available in Chrome at this time. If you have a USB OTG
cable you can even connect your keyboard to your Android phone or tablet.

# Tips for successful sight reading

## Practice daily

Sight reading takes a very long time to learn. Practice frequently to make
reading notes second nature. You goal should be able to see notes and instantly
know where to move your hands. As you get faster at reading, add more
simultaneous notes.

## Use real music

This app is not enough to learn how to sight read. Practice reading real sheet
music in addition to using this app. Read things that you have the skill to
play. Sight reading isn't just about recognizing the notes, but also playing
what's written. If you don't have the coordination to play something yet then
memorize that piece and find something else to sight read.

> **Author's tip:** Try your local thrift store to find music. You can generally
> find plenty of music you've never seen before of all different skill levels

## Practice without looking at your hands

Looking at your hands means less time reading sheet music.  Practice playing
notes without looking down. This isn't about memorizing the location of every
note on the keyboard, but rather understanding how your hands will move to go
to the next notes from the notes you just played.

## Practice chunking and reading ahead

Chunking means reading a block of notes at once then playing it out of your
memory. Reading ahead gives you time to figure out how to move your hands as
you're playing.
